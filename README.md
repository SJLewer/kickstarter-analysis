* Campaign Funding Goals:  Set reasonable, realistic goals ($3000-5000).  Campaigns with goals higher than $5000 tended to fail.

## Great Britain Musicals:  
The average campaign goal is around £4,000. However, this is outside the range of outliers pledged.  Based on these findings,
producing a musical for Great Britain audiences for less than £4,000 is likely to have a successful funding campaign.
